- ## Mutual Exclusion
  id:: 6858ac12-7876-40d7-abfa-36e7a54b46a8
	- ensure that only one process at a time can access the shared resource
	- more difficult in distributed system due to no shared memory or clock
	- why mutual exclusion?
		- prevent data inconsistency
		- maintain integrity
		- avoid race conditions
		- coordinate access to resource
	- Requirements
		- mutual exclusion (obviously)
		- progress (if no one in CS and some want to enter, one of them must be allowed to enter)
		- bounded waiting
		- no deadlock
		- no starvation
		- fault tolerance
	- There are two types of algorithm for implementing mutual exclusion in distributed system.
		- Non-token based
		- Token based
- ## Central Coordination Algorithm
  id:: 6858ae64-e3b7-445f-a2ee-eaf46585869e
	- simple non-token based algorithm for achieving mutual exclusion
	- A central coordination is present in the distributed system. Only it can grant or deny access to the critical section
	- **Algorithm**
		- Let, $P_1, P_2, ... P_n$ be the processes and $C$ be the coordination
		- Request Phase
			- A process $P_i$ sends a REQUEST message to the coordination when it wants to enter CS
		- Grant Phase
			- If no other processes are in CS, the coordination sends the GRANT message back to the requesting process.
			- If the CS is busy, the request is queued.
		- CS Execution
			- After receiving GRANT from the coordination, the process enters the CS
		- Release Phase
			- after process finishes its work in CS, it sends a RELEASE message to the coordinator. The coordinator then grants permission to next process in there are any in the queue
	- Advantages
		- simple and easy
		- requires only 3 messages per use of CS
		- fairness
	- Disadvantages
		- coordinator can become performance bottleneck
		- coordinator is a point of failure
- ## Ricart-Agrawala Non Token Based Algorithm
  id:: 6858b0e0-689c-4a07-921c-b8e22a6a851d
	- based on distributed agreement not central coordinator
	- the process that wants to enter CS sends request message to all other processes and only when it has received messages from all other processes can it enter CS
	- the request message is of the form $[T(P_i), i]$, where $T(P_i)$ is the process's timestamp and $i$ is its identifier
	- Each process is in one of three state with respect to CS: Released, Requested, Held
	- **Algorithms/Rules**
		- **Rule for Process Initialization**
			- performed by all processes
			- State($P_i$) := RELEASED
		- **Rule for access request**
			- when process $P_i$ wants to access the CS. it does the following
			- State($P_i$) := REQUESTED
			- $P_i$ sends a request message to all other processes
			- it then waits until it receives replies from all other processes
		- **Rule for executing the CS**
			- when process $P_i$ receives replies from all other process, it
			- State($P_i$) := HELD
			- $P_i$ enters CS
		- **Rule for handling incoming requests**
			- when process $P_i$ receives a request message from process $P_j$ (the message being $[T(P_j), j]$)
			- if $P_i$ is in the CS, that is State($P_i$) := HELD then queue the request without replying
			- if $P_i$ has also requested for the CS (State($P_i$) := REQUESTED) then it checks the priority. if $[T(P_i), i] \lt [T(P_j), j]$ (basically if $P_i$ made the request earlier than $P_j$) then also the request is queued without replying
			- otherwise reply immediately to $P_j$
		- **Rule for releasing CS**
			- after $P_i$ finishes its work in CS
			- State($P_i$) := RELEASED
			- reply to all queued requests
	- **Problems**
		- expensive in terms of message traffic: 2(n-1) messages required for each CS entry
		- failure of any process requires special recovery measures

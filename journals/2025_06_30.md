	- DONE start design of overlayfs for redox #major-project
- There is still one chapter left (chapter 2) to prepare for tomorrow's test but thats it for today
- I need to focus the #major-project as well
- Today I want to at least have the roughest of the rough [[Design of OverlayFS for Redox OS]]. It way as well be a design that would have to be changed completely but still needs to be something
- I finished with design -1. thats design minus 1 not design dash 1. so i finished taking about how the design 0 can come about. and i am feeling exhausted
- i still have one chapter left to study for tomorrows test, i havent completed the chapter 5 of atomics book, neither have i completed the third chapter of go book. so what should i read now

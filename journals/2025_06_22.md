- I am trying logseq again. I stopped using logseq last time because it refused to install on NixOs. It is the only notetaking app/system that didn't make me stop taking notes.
- more on that maybe [later]([[Organization and Management]]). #WritingIdeas
- Thinking of #learning #php
- Officially started working on #major-project
- and continue #learning #rust with [Atomics]([[Atomics in Rust]])
- I think I'll try to keep [[Interesting Things]] I come across
- for [[Jun 23rd, 2025]]
